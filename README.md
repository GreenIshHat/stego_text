🔍 stego_text.py — Hacker-Grade Messaging Layer (Open Call)

Just dropped a zero-width steganography tool:
A proof-of-concept Python script for invisibly embedding messages into text files using Unicode tricks (U+200B / U+200C).
Think ARGs, compression chains, code-narratives, or communication channels layered beneath the interface.

📦 Features:

    UTF-8-SIG compatible (for stealthy text/doc/email payloads)

    --multi mode for chaining hidden messages

    Binary ↔ zero-width mapping with customizable inject points

    Clean separation of encode/decode logic

🧪 Raw dev script. Open-ended use. Can serve as:

    a hidden messaging layer for creative apps

    stego component in dev tools or minimalist OS shells

    compression-adjacent tech for experimental pipelines

🧠 Next-Gen Compression Layer
[Project codename private]

    Started from a Hutter Prize trial. Now shaping into an extensible compression + dev OS layer:

        Non-standard BWT transforms, prime-sequence models

        Quantum-resistant stego + encryption

        Context-preserving pipelines for code, language, and knowledge

        Designed with long-term memory, even BCI/Neuralink-ready architecture

Looking for:

    📐 Compression + algorithm experts

    🔒 Steganography & encryption engineers

    ⚙️ System-level devs (Rust / C++ / Python)

    🖥️ Devtool UI/UX designers

    🧠 NLP/AI researchers (contextual L-model pipelines)

    🧬 BCI/Neuralink integration dreamers

    📑 IP/open-source/legal alignment strategists

📈 Also Seeking:

    Monetization lead or Technical Product Manager

    Growth strategist (Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, Ko-fi/Gumroad-ready)

    Community ops / social media manager
